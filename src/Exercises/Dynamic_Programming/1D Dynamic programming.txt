Basic theories of 1D dynamic programming

Repeating sub-problem
    For instance, calculating a same process more than once

Memoization -> Store the result and use it whenever it is needed

1D DP array -> 1(Changing variable)


Patters ->
    Recursion + Memoization
    Bottom up / Tabulation
    LIS -> Longest Increasing subsequence
    LCS -> Longest Common Subsequence
