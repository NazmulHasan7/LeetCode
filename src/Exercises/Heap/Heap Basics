Heap Data Structure
--> Heap is a complete binary tree that satisfies the heap property.
Complete binary tree - Each node has 2 children or left associated

Max Heap --> Root > child
Min Heap --> Root < child

Printing the tree in level order --> Consider as an array
Node --> i
Parent --> floor (i/2)
Left child --> 2 * i
Right child --> 2 * i + 1


Heap insert O(log(n)) --> Insert at the last level's left most position
then maintain the heap property (Swap if required from leaf to root)

Heap delete O(log(n)) --> Delete the root and the last level's right most
position takes place of the root, then maintain the heap property
